# Signup flow CRO

## Initial assessment

**Check for product marketing context first.**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Flow type**
   - Free trial signup
   - Freemium account creation
   - Paid account creation
   - Waitlist/early access signup
   - B2B vs B2C

2. **Current state**
   - How many steps/screens?
   - What fields are required?
   - What's the current completion rate?
   - Where do users drop off?

3. **Business constraints**
   - What data is genuinely needed at signup?
   - Are there compliance requirements?
   - What happens immediately after signup?

---

## Core principles

### 1. Minimize required fields
Every field reduces conversion. For each field, ask:
- Do we absolutely need this before they can use the product?
- Can we collect this later through progressive profiling?
- Can we infer this from other data?

**Typical field priority.**
- Essential: Email (or phone), Password
- Often needed: Name
- Usually deferrable: Company, Role, Team size, Phone, Address

### 2. Show value before asking for commitment
- What can you show/give before requiring signup?
- Can they experience the product before creating an account?
- Reverse the order: value first, signup second

### 3. Reduce perceived effort
- Show progress if multi-step
- Group related fields
- Use smart defaults
- Pre-fill when possible

### 4. Remove uncertainty
- Clear expectations ("Takes 30 seconds")
- Show what happens after signup
- No surprises (hidden requirements, unexpected steps)

---

## Field-by-field optimization

### Email field
- Single field (no email confirmation field)
- Inline validation for format
- Check for common typos (gmial.com → gmail.com)
- Clear error messages

### Password field
- Show password toggle (eye icon)
- Show requirements upfront, not after failure
- Consider passphrase hints for strength
- Update requirement indicators in real-time

**Better password UX.**
- Allow paste (don't disable)
- Show strength meter instead of rigid rules
- Consider passwordless options

### Name field
- Single "Full name" field vs. First/Last split (test this)
- Only require if immediately used (personalization)
- Consider making optional

### Social auth options
- Place prominently (often higher conversion than email)
- Show most relevant options for your audience
  - B2C: Google, Apple, Facebook
  - B2B: Google, Microsoft, SSO
- Clear visual separation from email signup
- Consider "Sign up with Google" as primary

### Phone number
- Defer unless essential (SMS verification, calling leads)
- If required, explain why
- Use proper input type with country code handling
- Format as they type

### Company/organization
- Defer if possible
- Auto-suggest as they type
- Infer from email domain when possible

### Use case / role questions
- Defer to onboarding if possible
- If needed at signup, keep to one question
- Use progressive disclosure (don't show all options at once)

---

## Single-step vs. multi-step

### Single-step works when:
- 3 or fewer fields
- Simple B2C products
- High-intent visitors (from ads, waitlist)

### Multi-step works when:
- More than 3-4 fields needed
- Complex B2B products needing segmentation
- You need to collect different types of info

### Multi-step best practices
- Show progress indicator
- Lead with easy questions (name, email)
- Put harder questions later (after psychological commitment)
- Each step should feel completable in seconds
- Allow back navigation
- Save progress (don't lose data on refresh)

**Progressive commitment pattern.**
1. Email only (lowest barrier)
2. Password + name
3. Customization questions (optional)

---

## Trust and friction reduction

### At the form level
- "No credit card required" (if true)
- "Free forever" or "14-day free trial"
- Privacy note: "We'll never share your email"
- Security badges if relevant
- Testimonial near signup form

### Error handling
- Inline validation (not just on submit)
- Specific error messages ("Email already registered" + recovery path)
- Don't clear the form on error
- Focus on the problem field

### Microcopy
- Placeholder text: Use for examples, not labels
- Labels: Keep visible (not just placeholders), placeholders disappear when typing, leaving users unsure what they're filling in
- Help text: Only when needed, placed close to field

---

## Mobile signup optimization

- Larger touch targets (44px+ height)
- Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, etc.)
- Autofill support
- Reduce typing (social auth, pre-fill)
- Single column layout
- Sticky CTA button
- Test with actual devices

---

## Post-submit experience

### Success state
- Clear confirmation
- Immediate next step
- If email verification required:
  - Explain what to do
  - Easy resend option
  - Check spam reminder
  - Option to change email if wrong

### Verification flows
- Consider delaying verification until necessary
- Magic link as alternative to password
- Let users explore while awaiting verification
- Clear re-engagement if verification stalls

---

## Measurement

### Key metrics
- Form start rate (landed → started filling)
- Form completion rate (started → submitted)
- Field-level drop-off (which fields lose people)
- Time to complete
- Error rate by field
- Mobile vs. desktop completion

### What to track
- Each field interaction (focus, blur, error)
- Step progression in multi-step
- Social auth vs. email signup ratio
- Time between steps

---

## Output format

### Audit findings
For each issue found:
- **Issue.** What's wrong
- **Impact.** Why it matters (with estimated impact if possible)
- **Fix.** Specific recommendation
- **Priority.** High/Medium/Low

### Recommended changes
Organized by:
1. Quick wins (same-day fixes)
2. High-impact changes (week-level effort)
3. Test hypotheses (things to A/B test)

### Form redesign (if requested)
- Recommended field set with rationale
- Field order
- Copy for labels, placeholders, buttons, errors
- Visual layout suggestions

---

## Task-specific questions

1. What's your current signup completion rate?
2. Do you have field-level analytics on drop-off?
3. What data is absolutely required before they can use the product?
4. Are there compliance or verification requirements?
5. What happens immediately after signup?
